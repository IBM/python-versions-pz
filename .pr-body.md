Add comprehensive tests and CI workflow for Python versions and manifests

Summary
- Purpose: Strengthen test coverage and CI to ensure Python versions, manifest models, and package compatibility remain stable across upgrades.
- Scope: Adds extensive unit tests for manifest parsing and merging, Pydantic models, Typer and Requests API compatibility, and cross-module imports; introduces a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on PRs.

Changes
- Tests:
  - `tests/test_models_and_manifest_tools.py`: Adds comprehensive tests validating:
    - `FileEntry` and `ManifestEntry` creation, validation, `model_dump`, JSON schema generation, copying, and error handling.
    - `manifest_fetch`, `manifest_merge`, and `update_version` behaviors including unique/overlapping versions and duplicate file handling.
    - Integration flow: fetch → merge → update, ensuring expected final manifest state.
    - Edge cases in parsing version lists, sorting stable vs prerelease, handling missing/empty/invalid entries.
  - `tests/test_package_compatibility.py`: Verifies compatibility with minimum package versions:
    - `requests >= 2.32.5`: `urlopen` response attributes and error handling via `fetch_json`, `get_nuget_versions`.
    - `typer >= 0.19.2`: app creation, options, echo, exit, and command registration.
    - `pydantic >= 2.11.7`: BaseModel instantiation, field validation, JSON schema, serialization, optional fields, strict validation, and nested models.
  - Additional tests for `get_python_version.PythonManifestParser` covering latest version retrieval with prerelease filters, unmatched filters, and complex sorting scenarios.
- CI:
  - Adds a GitHub Actions workflow to run the test suite on pushes/PRs, ensuring ongoing compatibility and preventing regressions.

Context
- Addresses gaps in automated verification for Python version handling and manifest tools that interact with multiple external dependencies and scripts.
- Ensures internal modules under `.github/scripts` and `PowerShell` remain importable and functionally compatible with pinned or minimum versions of third-party packages.

Commit History (branch-only)
- fa7ad5a: Add GitHub Actions workflow for running tests
- 4be49c6: Add comprehensive tests for Python version handling, models, and package compatibility

Impact
- Increases confidence in manifest operations and version parsing across a wide range of edge cases.
- Reduces risk of breakage from dependency updates to Requests, Typer, and Pydantic.
- Provides immediate CI feedback for future changes.

Testing
- New tests pass locally; CI workflow will run `pytest` on PR creation to validate across environments.

Risks
- None identified; changes are additive (tests + workflow) and do not modify production code paths.
