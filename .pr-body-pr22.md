## Problem

Build failures from transient network issues require manual workflow reruns. Specifically:
- `dotnet-install.py` fails on temporary HTTP 500/502/503/504 errors
- DNS timeouts and connection issues aren't retried
- Single transient failure affects entire multi-architecture build

## Solution

Add retry logic with exponential backoff and upgrade security scanning.

## Changes

**Build Reliability:**
- Add retry logic to `dotnet-install.py`: 8 attempts, 5s exponential backoff
- Handle HTTP 500/502/503/504 errors automatically
- Tolerate DNS failures and timeouts gracefully

**Security:**
- Upgrade Trivy: v0.58.1 → v0.68.2
- Enforce security gates: fail builds on HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities

## Files Changed

- `Makefile`: Trivy version and thresholds
- `PowerShell/dotnet-install.py`: Retry logic

## Impact

- ✅ Reduces flaky failures from temporary infrastructure issues
- ✅ Prevents vulnerable builds from passing
