Harden Python build pipeline with Trivy security gate, artifact normalization, and CI improvements

Summary
- Purpose: Introduce a consistent, security-aware build process for Python artifacts, with clear outputs and security reports to support automated release workflows.
- Scope: Adds Trivy scanning and a gate script, hardens Dockerfile and Makefile, normalizes artifact naming, and updates CI workflows to upload SBOM, vulnerability, and secret reports.

Changes
- Makefile:
  - Introduces normalized host artifact names including `linux-<UBUNTU_VERSION>-<ARCH>`.
  - Adds Trivy integration variables and gate thresholds, container runtime detection, and robust artifact extraction from the container.
  - Copies SBOM (`*.sbom.json`), Trivy vulnerability and secret reports, plus gate logs into `python-versions/output`.
  - Adds `verify-gate` target to print gate summary and logs.
- Dockerfile (`python-versions/Dockerfile`):
  - Hardens builder image: explicit `SHELL`, stricter compiler flags, trimmed installs, and cleanup.
  - Installs Trivy, performs pre-build secret/misconfig scans, and post-build SBOM + vulnerability + secret scans.
  - Adds `trivy-gate.sh` into the image and runs it, capturing `trivy-gate.log` and `trivy-gate-result.json`.
  - Recovers built Python into `/opt/Python/<version>/<arch>` and ensures `python3`/`pip3` links, healthcheck on `python3`.
- Trivy Gate Script (`python-versions/trivy-gate.sh`):
  - New script to enforce severity-based gating with configurable thresholds.
  - Produces machine-readable `trivy-gate-result.json` and human-readable `trivy-gate.log`.
  - Validates inputs, handles missing dependencies, and prints clear failure reasons.
- Workflows:
  - Adjusts matrix OS/arch definitions in sample workflow.
  - In release workflows, adds `contents: write`, sets Python `3.13`, fixes filter parsing, ensures Docker availability, and uploads all security artifacts and logs.
  - Enhances reusable release to accept a `files` input and improves manifest generation by robust asset parsing (handles `trivy-python-*` and `*.json`/`*.log`).

Context
- Ensures artifacts are consistent across CI and local builds, easing consumption by reusable workflows and release processes.
- Adds early detection of misconfigurations or secrets and records SBOMs for transparency and downstream analysis.
- Supports multi-arch builds and aligns naming with release asset expectations.

- 3563a26: chore(docker): harden builder image, add Trivy scans, artifact extraction & gate
- 069559a: feat(build): modernize Makefile — standardized artifacts, security gates & container extraction
- 257f554: ci(workflows): add Docker availability, upload security artifacts and robust manifest generation
- bc4b527: ci(workflows): harden workflows with quoting, matrix fixes and actionlint

Impact
- Improves supply-chain security posture with SBOMs and scanning outputs.
- Enables automated gating for critical/high issues and secret leaks.
- Standardizes artifacts to simplify downstream release and manifest updates.

Testing
- Local builds produce tar, SBOM, vulnerability/secret reports, gate JSON and log under `python-versions/output`.
- Healthcheck ensures `python3` availability in the final image.

Risks
- Gate thresholds can block builds if set to enforce critical/high findings; defaults currently non-blocking in Dockerfile gate invocation.
