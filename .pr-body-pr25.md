## Problem

Race conditions in manifest updates: multiple architecture builds commit to git simultaneously, causing conflicts and non-deterministic results.

**Current flow:**
1. Each architecture builds Python
2. Each commits manifest changes directly → race conditions
3. Retry on conflict → masks problems, doesn't solve them

## Solution

Decouple builds from git operations using single-writer pattern.

**New flow:**
1. Each architecture builds Python and generates partial manifest JSON (no git ops)
2. Upload partials as workflow artifacts
3. Single aggregation job downloads all partials and commits once atomically

## Changes

### `reusable-release-python-tar.yml` (-122 lines)
- **Removed:** All git operations (checkout, pull, commit, push)
- **Removed:** 100+ line bash asset parsing script
- **Added:** Call `generate_partial_manifest.py` (from PR #23)
- **Added:** Upload partial manifest as artifact
- **Renamed:** `release-assets-and-update-manifest` → `release-assets-and-generate-json`

### `release-latest-python-tag.yml` & `release-matching-python-tags.yml` (+75 lines each)
- **Added:** `update-manifests` job:
  - Downloads all partial manifest artifacts
  - Runs `apply_partial_manifests.py` (from PR #23)
  - Creates/updates version manifest files
  - Single atomic commit with concurrency control
  - **Idempotent**: Safe to retrigger, recollects all available artifacts
- **Changed:** `fail-fast: false` - preserve successful builds if one fails

### Minor Updates
- `generate_tar.yml`, `merge-manifest.yml`, `python-sample.yml`: Added `fail-fast: false`

## Impact

✅ **Eliminates race conditions** - single commit point  
✅ **Safe job retrigger** - failed jobs can be rerun independently  
✅ **Idempotent aggregation** - recollects artifacts and rebuilds manifests safely  
✅ **Atomic updates** - all-or-nothing commits  
✅ **Simpler code** - removed ~150 lines of complex bash  
✅ **Testable** - manifest generation tested in PR #23

## Recovery Example

If s390x build fails but ppc64le succeeds:
1. ppc64le uploads partial manifest artifact
2. s390x job fails (no artifact uploaded)
3. Aggregation job downloads available artifacts (ppc64le only)
4. Creates version manifest files and commits ppc64le entries

**To recover:**
1. Retrigger only the failed s390x job
2. s390x now uploads its partial manifest artifact
3. Aggregation job automatically retriggered
4. Downloads all available artifacts (ppc64le + s390x)
5. Recollects and recreates version manifest files with both architectures
6. Commits atomically - no conflicts, no lost data

**Key:** Aggregation is independent and idempotent - safely retriggering jobs causes it to recollect all artifacts and rebuild manifests.
