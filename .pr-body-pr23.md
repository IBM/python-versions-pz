## Problem

Two issues in release pipeline manifest updates:

1. **Race conditions**: Multiple architecture jobs write to shared manifest files simultaneously, causing conflicts
2. **Manifest pollution**: Trivy security artifacts (SBOMs, reports) uploaded with release binaries aren't filtered, risking incorrect URLs in manifests

## Solution

Create tooling for atomic manifest updates:
- Generate partial manifests per architecture (uploaded as artifacts, not committed)
- Single aggregation job merges all partials atomically
- Explicit filtering of non-release artifacts

## What This Provides

### `generate_partial_manifest.py`
Generates architecture-specific manifest JSON from release assets:
- Validates URLs are from GitHub releases
- **Filters out** SBOM files, Trivy reports, and logs
- Parses filenames: version, arch, platform
- Output: JSON for one architecture's builds

### `apply_partial_manifests.py`
Merges partial manifests into version manifest files:
- Discovers all partial JSON files
- Validates required fields
- Atomically updates manifests using existing tools
- Single aggregation point (used by PR #25)

## Tests

- `test_generate_partial_manifest.py` (219 lines): Parsing, validation, filtering
- `test_apply_partial_manifests.py` (88 lines): Discovery, loading, application
