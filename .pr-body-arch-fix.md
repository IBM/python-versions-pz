## Problem

CI testing workflows fail with `exec format error` because test matrix jobs request non-x64 architectures (ppc64le, s390x) but run on x64 runners, causing setup-python to download incompatible binaries.

## Solution

Bind architecture parameter to runner labels in test workflows to ensure jobs run on matching hardware.

## Changes

**Workflows Updated:**
- `python-sample.yml` and `tests.yml`

**Matrix Structure:**

Before (Broken):
```yaml
matrix:
  architecture: [x64, ppc64le, s390x]
  os: [ubuntu-24.04]
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}  # Always x64
```

After (Fixed):
```yaml
matrix:
  include:
    - runner: ubuntu-24.04
      arch: x64
    - runner: ubuntu-24.04-ppc64le
      arch: ppc64le
    - runner: ubuntu-24.04-s390x
      arch: s390x
runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}  # Matches architecture
```

**Additional:**
- Added `fail-fast: false` to prevent one architecture failure from cancelling others

## Impact

- ✅ Fixes `exec format error` in CI tests
- ✅ Ensures tests run on correct native hardware
- ℹ️ CI testing only - no changes to release workflows or manifests

## Testing

- Verified matrix correctly routes jobs to matching hardware
- Confirmed Python binaries download and execute successfully
